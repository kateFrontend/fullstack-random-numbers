Fullstack web application to generate 2 random numbers between 1 and 5.

Technical requirements for this challenge:

- use the JavaScript framework (for Front-end and Back-end) to build the solution
- create a place in the Front-end to display 2 numbers that will be generated
- display a button to start the generator
- display the numbers obtained by the Back-end in the place provided in the Frontend
- display a CSS animation of your choice: if the numbers are different (example 1 and 5)
- display a CSS animation of your choice: if the two digits match (example: 5 and 5)
- numbers must be generated randomly by the Back-end
- save all the results obtained in the Back-End (in memory). Don't use the database!
- retrieve from the Back-End the list of results obtained and display them on the screen
